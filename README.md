# 🕵️‍♂️ Responsible AI Inspector Blog

Welcome to the **AI Sleuth Files** – a fun, educational, and responsible look into how Artificial Intelligence can go wrong (and how to fix it!). This mini visual blog post explores two real-world scenarios where AI systems failed to be fair or transparent — and gives clear, human-friendly suggestions for improving them.

## 💡 What's Inside?

- 📄 **Two short AI case studies**

- 🎯 Clear analysis of what's happening, what’s wrong, and how to fix it.
- 🎨 Clean, modern design with a friendly tone.
- 🧠 Educational and creative writing to boost Responsible AI awareness.
